        <p>Unlike the other big upcoming horror remake, Resident Evil 4, Silent Hill 2 will be a PS5 console exclusive. The game will only be available on PS5 and PC (via Steam). Because it is being made in Unreal Engine 5, last-generation systems are out of the question, and it should be able to take better advantage of the newer system's horsepower.
          Silent Hill 2's remake will be a retelling of the story from the first version, which released back in 2001. Set in the titular town, Silent Hill 2 sees the writer James Sunderland searching for his long-dead wife after receiving a letter--ostensibly from her. There, James finds a number of ghastly horrors awaiting him, including famous enemies like Pyramid Head as well as the unhinged Eddie Dombrowski. Could there be some darker force at play here? Could a cult of Shiba Inu dogs actually be behind it all? You'll have to play to find out.
        <p>Silent Hill 2 will remain a survival-horror game, with the development team consulting original developers Akira Yamaoka and Masahiro Ito throughout the process to ensure its essence is kept intact. However, it's also being modernized to better fit modern expectations. Like the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, Silent Hill 2 will utilize an over-the-shoulder perspective rather than the zoomed-out view more common in horror games at the turn of the century.
        The combat system, naturally, is getting a full overhaul as a result of the change, as are "certain set-pieces," according to producer Motoi Okamoto and director Mateusz Lenart.
        On PS5, you'll be able to make use of 3D audio technology to determine where a sound came from, and there will be no loading screens due to the NVMe SSD. Haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support are included, as well, though the team is keeping their exact implementation a secret for now.</p>

        <p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, is a genre-defying, action-adventure third-person shooter from Rocksteady Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series. 

          Featuring an original narrative set within an expansive open-world city of Metropolis, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts the four DC Super-Villains on a collision course with an invading alien force and DC Super Heroes who are now laser-focused on destroying the city they once vowed to protect. All the while, the Suicide Squad must be mindful of the lethal explosives implanted in their heads that could go off at the first sign of defiance.
          <p>
            Each squad member has their own unique moveset with enhanced traversal abilities to freely explore the dynamic open-world of Metropolis, along with a variety of weapons to customize, and skills to master. 

            Take down The Justice League yourself in single-player or team up with friends in multiplayer co-op.
