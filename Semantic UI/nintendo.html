              <h2>About the Nintendo Switch</h2>
              <p>The Nintendo Switch is a highly popular and versatile gaming console developed and released by Nintendo. It was first launched in March 2017 and quickly gained a large following due to its unique design and a library of both first-party and third-party games.
                The Nintendo Switch is known for its hybrid design, which allows it to be used as both a home console and a portable handheld device. It can be docked to play games on a TV or taken on the go as a portable gaming system.
                The console comes with detachable controllers called Joy-Cons. These can be used individually for two-player gaming or attached to the console for single-player play. They include motion controls and HD rumble for immersive gameplay experiences.
                Nintendo offers a paid online service called Nintendo Switch Online, which provides access to online multiplayer, classic NES and SNES games, and cloud save data backup.</p>

        <p>Nintendo’s upcoming Princess Peach game has a name: Princess Peach: Showtime!, revealed during Thursday’s Nintendo Direct. First teased in June, the solo adventure game is the first game starring the Mushroom Kingdom’s princess in more than 17 years. It’s coming to Nintendo Switch on March 22, 2024.
          In the trailer, Toad brings Princess Peach an invite to a theater, where things go very wrong.
          A mysterious enemy called Wicked Grape and the Sour Bunch takes over the theater stage, and it’s up to Peach and the theater guardian, Stella, to save the play. Stella can assist Peach by helping her transform into different costumes, like a sword-fighting outfit, to fight off the baddies. There are a bunch of different plays for Peach to save, including ones where Peach gets to be a detective, baker, and lots more. Gameplay changes based off Peach’s outfit, which means Princess Peach: Showtime! looks to have a ton of variety.</p>
