              <h2>About the PC</h2>
              <p>Personal computers are versatile computing devices that have had a profound impact on virtually every aspect of modern life, from work to entertainment and communication. Here are some key aspects of PCs.
                PCs come in various form factors, including desktops, laptops, all-in-one computers, and even small form factor PCs like mini-PCs and gaming consoles. This diversity allows individuals to choose a computer that suits their specific needs.
               PCs run a wide range of operating systems, with Microsoft Windows, macOS (for Apple computers), and Linux being the most common. Each operating system has its own interface, features, and software ecosystem.
                Unlike many other computing devices, PCs are highly customizable. Users can upgrade components such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage to tailor their PC's performance to their needs. This is particularly important for gamers and professionals who require high-end hardware.
                PCs are versatile and serve multiple purposes. They are used for work, gaming, entertainment, communication, and much more.
                PC gaming is a major segment of the gaming industry, with a vast library of games, including both PC exclusives and multi-platform titles. High-performance gaming PCs offer cutting-edge graphics and processing power.

        <p>Fight your way through a modern-day Seattle on the brink of an open war as an elder Vampire. Meet the power-players, ally yourself and decide who will rule and what the city will become.

          A three-front siege on Seattle, a power vacuum in the vampire court and an awakened elder at odds with the voice in her head, realized by BAFTA award winning studio, The Chinese Room.</p>
          <p>Blood sustains you and powers your vampiric Disciplines. You’ll stalk and feed on the city’s population by night. Use your supernatural powers or raw persuasion on civilians and lure them into deep, dark alleys to sate your Hunger. Beware of breaking the Masquerade though: do not reveal what you are or you risk reprisals -  at first from law enforcement and then, well, remember you are not all that goes bump in this night.

            Explore visceral, immersive combat rewarding entirely different playstyles and approaches based on your choice of vampire clan. Will you wade into the fray with supernatural fists, harangue from afar or rebalance your odds by thinning the herd like the apex predator you are? Clan choice supports these playstyles and more.

        <p>Unlike the other big upcoming horror remake, Resident Evil 4, Silent Hill 2 will be a PS5 console exclusive. The game will only be available on PS5 and PC (via Steam). Because it is being made in Unreal Engine 5, last-generation systems are out of the question, and it should be able to take better advantage of the newer system's horsepower.
          Silent Hill 2's remake will be a retelling of the story from the first version, which released back in 2001. Set in the titular town, Silent Hill 2 sees the writer James Sunderland searching for his long-dead wife after receiving a letter--ostensibly from her. There, James finds a number of ghastly horrors awaiting him, including famous enemies like Pyramid Head as well as the unhinged Eddie Dombrowski. Could there be some darker force at play here? Could a cult of Shiba Inu dogs actually be behind it all? You'll have to play to find out.
        <p>Silent Hill 2 will remain a survival-horror game, with the development team consulting original developers Akira Yamaoka and Masahiro Ito throughout the process to ensure its essence is kept intact. However, it's also being modernized to better fit modern expectations. Like the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, Silent Hill 2 will utilize an over-the-shoulder perspective rather than the zoomed-out view more common in horror games at the turn of the century.
        The combat system, naturally, is getting a full overhaul as a result of the change, as are "certain set-pieces," according to producer Motoi Okamoto and director Mateusz Lenart.
        On PS5, you'll be able to make use of 3D audio technology to determine where a sound came from, and there will be no loading screens due to the NVMe SSD. Haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support are included, as well, though the team is keeping their exact implementation a secret for now.</p>

        <p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, is a genre-defying, action-adventure third-person shooter from Rocksteady Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series. 

          Featuring an original narrative set within an expansive open-world city of Metropolis, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts the four DC Super-Villains on a collision course with an invading alien force and DC Super Heroes who are now laser-focused on destroying the city they once vowed to protect. All the while, the Suicide Squad must be mindful of the lethal explosives implanted in their heads that could go off at the first sign of defiance.
          <p>
            Each squad member has their own unique moveset with enhanced traversal abilities to freely explore the dynamic open-world of Metropolis, along with a variety of weapons to customize, and skills to master. 

            Take down The Justice League yourself in single-player or team up with friends in multiplayer co-op.
            
            Don't be a hero.</p>
