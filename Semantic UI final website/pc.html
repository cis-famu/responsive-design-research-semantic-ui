              <h2>About the PC</h2>
              <p>Personal computers are versatile computing devices that have had a profound impact on virtually every aspect of modern life, from work to entertainment and communication. Here are some key aspects of PCs.
                PCs come in various form factors, including desktops, laptops, all-in-one computers, and even small form factor PCs like mini-PCs and gaming consoles. This diversity allows individuals to choose a computer that suits their specific needs.
               PCs run a wide range of operating systems, with Microsoft Windows, macOS (for Apple computers), and Linux being the most common. Each operating system has its own interface, features, and software ecosystem.
                Unlike many other computing devices, PCs are highly customizable. Users can upgrade components such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage to tailor their PC's performance to their needs. This is particularly important for gamers and professionals who require high-end hardware.
                PCs are versatile and serve multiple purposes. They are used for work, gaming, entertainment, communication, and much more.
                PC gaming is a major segment of the gaming industry, with a vast library of games, including both PC exclusives and multi-platform titles. High-performance gaming PCs offer cutting-edge graphics and processing power.

        <p>Fight your way through a modern-day Seattle on the brink of an open war as an elder Vampire. Meet the power-players, ally yourself and decide who will rule and what the city will become.
          A three-front siege on Seattle, a power vacuum in the vampire court and an awakened elder at odds with the voice in her head, realized by BAFTA award winning studio, The Chinese Room.</p>
        <p>Blood sustains you and powers your vampiric Disciplines. You’ll stalk and feed on the city’s population by night. Use your supernatural powers or raw persuasion on civilians and lure them into deep, dark alleys to sate your Hunger. Beware of breaking the Masquerade though: do not reveal what you are or you risk reprisals -  at first from law enforcement and then, well, remember you are not all that goes bump in this night.
          Explore visceral, immersive combat rewarding entirely different playstyles and approaches based on your choice of vampire clan. Will you wade into the fray with supernatural fists, harangue from afar or rebalance your odds by thinning the herd like the apex predator you are? Clan choice supports these playstyles and more.
